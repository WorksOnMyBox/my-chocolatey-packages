# IMPORTANT: Before releasing this package, copy/paste the next 2 lines into PowerShell to remove all comments from this file:
#   $f='c:\path\to\thisFile.ps1'
#   gc $f | ? {$_ -notmatch "^\s*#"} | % {$_ -replace '(^.*?)\s*?[^``]#.*','$1'} | Out-File $f+".~" -en utf8; mv -fo $f+".~" $f

# 1. See the _TODO.md that is generated top level and read through that
# 2. Follow the documentation below to learn how to create a package for the package type you are creating.
# 3. In Chocolatey scripts, ALWAYS use absolute paths - $toolsDir gets you to the package's tools directory.
